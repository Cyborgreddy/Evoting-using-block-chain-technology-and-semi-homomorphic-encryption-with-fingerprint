**eVoting System Using Blockchain Technology with Semi-Homomorphic Encryption and Fingerprint Verification**

**Introduction:**

This repository contains the codebase for an electronic voting (eVoting) system that utilizes Java with Tomcat for the backend, blockchain technology for transparency, semi-homomorphic encryption for secure vote tallying, and fingerprint verification for identity authentication.

**Features:**

1. **Blockchain Technology:** Utilizes blockchain to ensure transparency, immutability, and decentralization of the voting process.

2. **Semi-Homomorphic Encryption:** Implements semi-homomorphic encryption to enable secure vote tallying without compromising voter privacy.

3. **Fingerprint Verification:** Integrates fingerprint verification for identity authentication, ensuring that only eligible voters can cast their votes.

**Dependencies:**

- Java 8+
- Apache Tomcat
- Solidity
- Truffle Framework
- Web3j
- Fingerprint SDK/Drivers

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/evoting-blockchain.git
   ```

2. Set up Apache Tomcat and configure it to run the eVoting web application.

3. Install Solidity and Truffle Framework for smart contract development.

4. Connect a fingerprint sensor device compatible with the provided SDK or drivers.

**Usage:**

1. **Smart Contract Deployment:**
   - Use Truffle Framework to compile and deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain network of your choice.

2. **Server Setup:**
   - Deploy the eVoting web application to Apache Tomcat.

3. **Client Access:**
   - Access the eVoting platform through a web browser by navigating to the specified URL.
   - Voters can authenticate using fingerprint verification and cast their votes securely.

4. **Vote Tallying:**
   - After the voting period ends, authorized parties can tally the votes securely using the provided scripts.

**Security Considerations:**

- Ensure that the blockchain network is secure and resistant to attacks.
- Protect sensitive data such as private keys and encrypted votes.
- Regularly update and patch all dependencies to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
